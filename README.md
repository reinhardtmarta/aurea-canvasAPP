# Aurea Canvas

**An infinite canvas for non-linear thinking**

Aurea Canvas is a mobile app built with Flutter that lets you freely sketch ideas, insert geometric shapes, spirals, vectors, angles, and equations — all in one infinite space.

Tap "Ask AI" and watch your chaotic drawing transform into structured math: LaTeX equations, step-by-step explanations, and ready-to-run Python code.

Perfect for mathematicians, physicists, artists, students, and neurodivergent minds who think visually first.

## Features

- **Infinite canvas** with zoom & pan (coming soon)
- Freehand drawing + precise geometric tools  
  (circle, triangle, square, diamond, hexagon, line, spiral, angle, vector)
- Quick text/equation insertion with math examples
- Linear mode (notebook lines) vs Non-Linear mode
- AI panel: interprets your sketch and generates LaTeX, explanations, and Python code
- Designed for stylus/tablet use (pressure sensitivity planned)
